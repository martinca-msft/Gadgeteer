PREREQUISITES

To build GadgeteerCore, you need to have Visual Studio 2010 and the following packages.
- Visual C# 2010 Express and Visual Basic 2010 Express (this is not a prerequisite but if you want it to test, then install it before .NET MF below) http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/en-us/products/2010-editions/visual-csharp-express
- Visual Studio 2010 SP1 http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=23691 (install this first)
- Microsoft .NET Micro Framework 4.2 
- Visual Studio 2010 SP1 SDK http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/details.aspx?FamilyID=21307c23-f0ff-4ef2-a0a4-dca54ddb1e21 (NB this used to be the Visual Studio 2010 SDK - there's a new one for SP1)
- Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 Visualization & Modeling SDK http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/details.aspx?FamilyID=0def949d-2933-49c3-ac50-e884e0ff08a7
- WiX v3.5 http://wix.codeplex.com/releases/view/60102

DIRECTORY LAYOUT OF THE REPOSITORY

The repository is designed to mirror the CodePlex repository, which means the structure includes spaces for third party modules/mainboards/etc.

ADDING NEW MODULES/MAINBOARDS/KITS

It is slightly tricky to get the directory structure right when adding a new module/mainboard/kit.  

See http://gadgeteer.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=HOWTO%3a%20Get%20the%20directory%20structure%20right%20with%20new%20modules&referringTitle=Documentation
for some help

END USER PC LOCATIONS 

This is where files end up on the end user's PC.  Some files come from the GadegteerCore installer, some from GadgeteerBuilderTemplates.
NB our installers are only targeting "all users" at the moment, so need elevated privileges to install.

GADGETEERCORE: NOTES ON DESIGNER

The designer is written using T4 text templates http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb126445.aspx for code generation.
The source TT files are compiled to get CS files. Building shouldnï¿½t require you to check everything out, but sometimes the text template generation gets triggered when building. 
This tries to write all the .cs files under GeneratedCode (for both projects) so they need to be checked out.  Or, hit the button under Solution Explorer's toolbar which does a "Transform All Templates" and this will auto-check-out the files.
To test the designer, set DslPackage as a startup project and hit F5 - this launches an experimental instance of VS which has the package installed.

Additional information on the designer can be found in GadgeteerCore\VisualStudio\VSDesignerDevGuide.docx

BUILDING GADGETEER CORE/BUILDER TEMPLATES

This is a little complex :)

We have TWO msi outputs - GadgeteerCore and GadgeteerBuilderTemplates.
We have THREE sln files - GadgeteerCore, GadgeteerBuilderTemplates and VSDesigner (all in the GadgeteerCore directory)

GadgeteerCore.msi is built by the GadgeteerCoreMSI wix project in GadgeteerCore.sln, and relies on:
	- The projects in that SLN file
	- The VSDesigner's InstallerModule.msm file (location specified in Components.wxi) 
	- The version of the DLLs/MSI is controlled using AssemblyInfoGlobal.cs AND version.wxi (keep both in sync)
	- NB the dlls are NOT signed/signable since NETMF dlls are NOT strong named
	- This installer shows a license dialog, configured in ui\CommonDialogs.wxi to be one of two:
		- For prerelease versions (to be shared with manufacturers under NDA), we use an evaluation license
		- For release versions we use Apache 2.0.  

The VSDesigner's InstallerModule MSM project is found in VSDesigner.sln, and relies on:
	- SIGNED dlls for the Dsl, DslPackage and VSModuleManager projects (location specified in MergeModule.wxs)
		- The BuildAndSign.cmd kicks off signing of these projects using https://codesign/
		- You will need to have the three DLLs declared as trusted using "sn -Vr <dll name>" to build DslPackage
	- The version of the DLLs AND the MSM is controlled using version.txt

GadgeteerBuilderTemplates.msi is built by the BuilderTemplateInstaller wix project in GadgeteerBuilderTemplates.sln, and relies on:
	- The projects in that SLN file
	- A SIGNED dll for the HardwareTemplateWizard project (location specified in Product.wxs)
		- The SignWizardAssembly.cmd kicks off signing of these projects using https://codesign/
	- The version of the MSI is controlled using version.wxi (shared with GadgeteerCore.sln)

Copies of installers are placed in $\Builds - follow the pattern there, and often in \\gadgeteer\share\drops or \\gadgeteer\share\releases
Version number schema is documented in GadgeteerCore\AssemblyInfoGlobal.cs

To build and sign the two MSIs (after the previous two DLL signing stages are already done, and the version numbers are all the same), use GadgeteerCore\SignMSIs.cmd.

GADGETEERCORE: KNOWN ISSUES

-- Pathname length problem with VS templates
The VS templates live at [ProgramFilesFolder]Microsoft Visual Studio 10.0\Common7\IDE\{VCSExpress}Extensions\[Manufacturer]\Gadgeteer\ProjectTemplates\CSharp\Gadgeteer\1033\*.zip 
Unfortunately these paths+filenames turns out to be TOO LONG for VS to parse (bug in VS?).  So instead of the source filename e.g. GadgeteerSimpleGraphicsAppTemplate.zip, the installer uses short target names, e.g. SG.zip
